Dataset introduction:
ImperialDance, which comprises 69,300 seconds of dance motions and music, 5 genres, 20 pieces of music and 20 choreographies with dancers of 3 different expertise levels.
Two advantages of our dataset could be summarized as:
(i) It is the first dataset that describes the expertise level differences of dancing, which promotes the research on dacning skill assessment.
(ii) Compared to other dance-music datasets, which only provide one sample of the dance motion per choreography, we provide 100 repeating samples for each class (per music, genre, choreography, and expertise level). This will benefit the feature learning of particular dance motions and level progression modeling.
